# Python_Coding_Practice

These are questions and my sample solutions to questions posted on LeetCode.com

## Note
Just so that the code is runnable, I am using Python's built in Unittest to test some sample inputs.  Since I am coding my solution exactly to the question as asked, I am not writing tests that would be written in other contexs.  For example, the Two Sum exercise states that the input will always be valid and have a one correct answer/output for it, thus I am not testing for robustness/behavior of my solution code when it gets the invalid input data.
